/**
 * @name KnxCoordinator.h
 * @date 18.07.2026
 * @authors Florian Wiesner
 * @details The KNX bus node. It sends values to group addresses, receives telegrams and delivers
 *          them to the device objects attached to it, and exposes begin(), loop() and the debug
 *          switch a sketch calls on its `knx` object.
 *
 *          Most sketches never name this class directly: they create a `Konnextra` (Konnextra.h),
 *          which is a KnxCoordinator that also owns its bus driver, so the driver is set up for
 *          you. Use KnxCoordinator directly only for the advanced case of supplying your own
 *          driver (IKnxDriver) — for example a custom transceiver or a mock in a host test.
