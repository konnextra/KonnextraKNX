/**
 * @name main.cpp
 * @date 19.07.2026
 * @authors Florian Wiesner
 * @details HARDWARE BENCH TEST for the KNX library — no buttons, no user input.
 *
 *          A single light is toggled every 5 s, and every status telegram the bus sends back is
 *          printed over Serial — both the DPT1 on/off status and the DPT5 brightness the dimmer
 *          publishes. Between them these exercise the two paths host tests cannot reach: the
 *          driver's real transmit path (does the ATTiny accept the frame and return a positive
 *          L_Data.con?) and the receive path (reassemble -> parse -> match -> decode -> callback),
 *          the latter across two objects and two different DPTs.
 *
 *          Watch the serial monitor at 115200 baud. Expected per cycle: one "[send] toggle" line
 *          with "confirmed", then one "[bus]" status line, and — if the actuator ramps — one or
 *          more brightness lines. See the failure guide at the bottom of this file.

//---- Libraries ----
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Konnextra.h>     // the whole library: driver + coordinator + values + intent objects

//---- Configuration ----
#define BAUDRATE_SERIAL     115200
#define PHYS_ADDR           "1.1.5"   // this device's KNX physical address
#define TOGGLE_INTERVAL_MS  5000      // how often to flip the light

// Flip to true when something misbehaves: traces every telegram sent and received (including
// foreign ones), frame build/parse, value coding and driver traffic, all prefixed with [knx].
// Left off by default — the printing itself costs time on the receive path, so a clean run
// should be established first and the verbose trace used to explain a broken one.
#define KNX_VERBOSE         true

//---- Bench wiring: UART1 on this board's KNX pins ----
// The driver no longer owns a UART, so the port is named here and its pins are set in
// setup(). UART1 is the same peripheral the driver used to construct for itself.
//
// The order below is deliberate and NOT what the pin names suggest. Before the port was
// injected, bring-up read:
//     uart.begin(baud, SERIAL_8E1, txPin, rxPin);   // txPin = D7, rxPin = D6
// and the ESP32 signature is begin(baud, config, rxPin, txPin) — so the two were passed
// swapped, and the configuration that actually worked on the bench is
//     ESP32 RX = D7,  ESP32 TX = D6.
// That is what setPins(rx, tx) reproduces below. Do not "fix" it to (D6, D7) without
// re-checking the board: the pin table in CLAUDE.md says the opposite and is wrong.

	//
	// Commented out for the ESP32-WROOM bench run: D6/D7 are XIAO aliases and do not exist
	// on that variant, so the line does not even compile there. Without it UART1 keeps the
	// core's own defaults — RX = GPIO 26, TX = GPIO 27 on a classic ESP32.
	// UNCOMMENT BEFORE GOING BACK TO THE XIAO, or it will talk on the wrong pins.

/*
 * Reading a bad run:
 *
 *   no output at all          → serial/board problem, not KNX.
 *   "driver FAILED"           → ATTiny not answering the U_ reset handshake (wiring, baud, power).
 *   "no ACK" every cycle      → send path reaches the transceiver but no positive L_Data.con.
 *                               CON_MASK / CON_PATTERN / CON_POSITIVE in KnxDriver.h match the
 *                               TP-UART2 datasheet and a 0x8B bench reading, so look past them
 *                               to bus power, the ATTiny, or a genuinely NAK'd frame.
 *   "confirmed" but no [bus]  → TX works, RX does not: the actuator is not sending status, or
 *                               its status GAs differ, or reassembly/parse is failing.
 *   1/1/1 arrives, 0/2/1 not  → RX and dispatch are fine (one object matched); the dimmer is
 *                               simply not publishing brightness, or not on 0/2/1.
 *   brightness always 0 / 100 → DPT5 decode or the 0..255 -> 0..100 rescale is suspect.
 *   [bus] but light unchanged → the telegram is fine; the actuator is not acting on 0/1/1.
